# Excel Online Compatibility Template Configuration
# This file contains specifications for Excel Online compatible features

# Excel Online Limitations and Workarounds:

## Supported Features:
# - Basic Power Query (limited transformations)
# - Pivot Tables (basic functionality)
# - Charts (standard types only)
# - Conditional Formatting (basic rules)
# - Slicers (basic filtering)
# - Tables and structured references
# - Basic formulas and functions

## Not Supported in Excel Online:
# - VBA Macros
# - External data connections (limited)
# - Advanced Power Query transformations
# - Complex custom functions
# - ActiveX controls
# - Advanced chart types

## Workarounds for Excel Online:

### 1. Replace VBA with Office Scripts
# Use Office Scripts (TypeScript) instead of VBA for automation
# Store scripts in the cloud for online execution

### 2. Simplified Data Connections
# Pre-configure data connections in desktop Excel
# Use simplified refresh mechanisms
# Implement manual refresh procedures

### 3. Basic Chart Types Only
# Stick to column, line, pie, and bar charts
# Avoid advanced chart types like treemap, waterfall
# Use conditional formatting for visual impact

### 4. Manual Process Documentation
# Since automation is limited, provide clear manual steps
# Create step-by-step refresh procedures
# Document workaround processes

## Excel Online Template Structure:

### Worksheet Layout:
# 1. Dashboard (Executive Summary)
# 2. Data (Simplified raw data)
# 3. Analysis (Basic pivot tables)
# 4. Charts (Standard chart types)
# 5. Instructions (Manual process guide)

### Data Refresh Process for Excel Online:
# 1. Open workbook in desktop Excel
# 2. Run full refresh using VBA macros
# 3. Save file to cloud storage
# 4. View updated dashboard in Excel Online
# 5. Share with stakeholders online

### Simplified Formula Examples:
# =SUMIFS(Data[ComplianceScore],Data[RiskLevel],"High")
# =COUNTIF(Data[BusinessImpact],"Critical")
# =AVERAGE(Data[ComplianceScore])
# =MAX(Data[LastModified])

### Basic Conditional Formatting:
# Risk Level: Use icon sets (traffic lights)
# Compliance Score: Use color scales (red-yellow-green)
# Date fields: Use data bars for age visualization

### Standard Chart Configurations:
# Risk Distribution: Pie chart with data labels
# Compliance Trends: Line chart with markers
# Department Analysis: Column chart with legend
# Top Risks: Horizontal bar chart

### Slicer Configuration for Online:
# - Keep slicers simple (single-select preferred)
# - Use clear, descriptive titles
# - Position for easy mobile access
# - Test cross-filtering functionality

### Mobile Optimization:
# - Use larger touch targets (min 44px)
# - Optimize for portrait orientation
# - Simplify navigation between sheets
# - Ensure readability on small screens

## Office Scripts Alternative (TypeScript):

function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
  // Get the Data worksheet
  let dataSheet = workbook.getWorksheet("Data");
  
  // Refresh data (manual step required)
  console.log("Please refresh data manually using desktop Excel");
  
  // Update dashboard calculations
  let dashboardSheet = workbook.getWorksheet("Dashboard");
  
  // Calculate key metrics
  let totalFlows = dataSheet.getUsedRange().getRowCount() - 1;
  let highRiskCount = 0; // Would need to implement counting logic
  
  // Update KPI cells
  dashboardSheet.getCell(1, 1).setValue(totalFlows);
  dashboardSheet.getCell(2, 1).setValue(highRiskCount);
  
  console.log("Dashboard updated successfully");
}
