# Security Assessment Methodology

This document outlines the security assessment methodology, criteria, and standards used by the Power Automate Security Assessment Tool.

## Assessment Framework

### Security Domains
The assessment evaluates four primary security domains:
1. **Environment Governance**
2. **Identity and Access Management**
3. **Data Protection and Connectivity**
4. **Process and Flow Security**

### Risk Classification System
- **HIGH RISK**: Immediate security threats requiring urgent remediation
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Significant security concerns requiring planned remediation
- **LOW RISK**: Best practice improvements and optimization opportunities

  - *Risk*: Difficult access management
  - *Impact*: Access review complications

- **External Users with Access**
  - *Criteria*: Guest/external users in environment

  - *Impact*: Data sovereignty concerns

#### LOW RISK Findings
- **Inactive User Access**
  - *Criteria*: Users with no activity in 90+ days
  - *Risk*: Dormant account access
  - *Impact*: Unnecessary access exposure

### Role Assignment Validation

#### Assessment Criteria
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users have minimum required access
- **Role Segregation**: Clear separation between admin and user roles
- **Access Review Process**: Regular validation of access assignments

## Data Protection and Connectivity Assessment

### High-Risk Connector Analysis

#### HIGH RISK Connectors
- **SQL Server**: Direct database access
- **File System**: Local file access
- **FTP/SFTP**: File transfer protocols
- **Custom Connectors**: Unvalidated external connections

#### MEDIUM RISK Connectors
- **SharePoint**: Document management access
- **Office 365 Outlook**: Email and calendar access
- **OneDrive for Business**: File storage access
- **Microsoft Teams**: Communication platform access

#### Assessment Criteria
- **Authentication Method**: OAuth vs. basic authentication
- **Data Scope**: Read-only vs. read-write access
- **Business Justification**: Documented need for connector

### Connection Security

#### HIGH RISK Findings
- **Failed/Inactive Connections**
  - *Criteria*: Connection status indicates failure
  - *Risk*: Potential security bypass
  - *Impact*: Data access interruption

- **Basic Authentication Usage**
  - *Criteria*: Non-OAuth authentication methods
  - *Risk*: Credential exposure
  - *Impact*: Authentication compromise

#### MEDIUM RISK Findings
- **Premium Connector Licensing**
  - *Criteria*: Premium connectors without proper licensing
  - *Risk*: Compliance violations
  - *Impact*: Service interruption

- **Shared Connection Accounts**
  - *Criteria*: Multiple flows using same connection
  - *Risk*: Access attribution issues
  - *Impact*: Audit trail confusion

## Process and Flow Security Assessment

### Flow Trigger Security

#### HIGH RISK Findings
- **HTTP Triggers Without Authentication**
  - *Criteria*: HTTP request triggers with anonymous access
  - *Risk*: Unauthorized flow execution
  - *Impact*: Data manipulation, resource abuse

- **Email Triggers with External Access**
  - *Criteria*: Email triggers accepting external messages
  - *Risk*: Email-based attacks
  - *Impact*: Malicious flow execution

#### MEDIUM RISK Findings
- **Manual Triggers with Broad Access**
  - *Criteria*: Manual triggers shared with multiple users
  - *Risk*: Uncontrolled execution
  - *Impact*: Unauthorized operations

- **Scheduled Flows with Sensitive Data**
  - *Criteria*: Time-based triggers processing sensitive information
  - *Risk*: Automated data exposure
  - *Impact*: Compliance violations

### Flow Sharing and Ownership

#### MEDIUM RISK Findings
- **Multiple Flow Owners**
  - *Criteria*: Flows with >3 owners
  - *Risk*: Unclear accountability
  - *Impact*: Change control issues

- **External User Flow Sharing**
  - *Criteria*: Flows shared with guest users
  - *Risk*: External access to business processes
  - *Impact*: Data sovereignty concerns

#### LOW RISK Findings
- **Dormant Flows**
  - *Criteria*: Enabled flows without modifications in 90+ days
  - *Risk*: Unnecessary resource usage
  - *Impact*: Maintenance overhead

### Data Flow Analysis

#### Assessment Areas
- **Data Classification**: Sensitivity of processed data
- **Data Retention**: How long data is stored
- **Data Location**: Geographic location of data processing
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption in transit and at rest

## Assessment Scoring System

### Severity Scoring
- **HIGH RISK**: 8-10 points per finding
- **MEDIUM RISK**: 4-7 points per finding  
- **LOW RISK**: 1-3 points per finding

### Environment Security Score
```
Score = (High Risk × 10) + (Medium Risk × 5) + (Low Risk × 1)
Risk Level:
- 0-10: Low Risk Environment
- 11-25: Medium Risk Environment
- 26+: High Risk Environment
```
